Law programme features prominently among other faculties and colleges.
                                    The Faculty of Law, Elizade University, Ilara-Mokin, Ondo State places a high value on teaching and research, and these two are given prime priorities as reflected in the curriculum and entire package of the LL.B programme being offered by the faculty. We note that there is a paradigm shift in the practice of law to meet with the pace at which the global world is adapting to evolving changes in the socio-economic and political landscape, we are therefore committed to providing modern and contemporary legal education and research needed to succeed in the ever-developing world. We are poised to produce knowledgeable intellectuals and skilled professionals equipped to contribute to the national economic and social development in all ramifications where law knowledge will be required.
                                    Against the background that the knowledge of the law is relevant and needed in every segment of society, the faculty is set to establish a workable and beneficent relationship with the outside world both in academic and relevant industries. The faculty is also blessed with academic staff members and non-academic support staff who provide qualitative scholarship and moral rectitude to ensure that the students realise their lofty goals, dreams, and aspirations of becoming law experts in the diverse and multifaceted areas of law. The faculty's human efforts are uniquely complemented with the cultural hub, serenity and natural ambience, all of which guarantee a conducive environment for students to learn.
                                    Over 70 percent of the staff members are PhD holders in diverse areas of law and are graduates from reputable universities, both onshore and offshore. A modern separate law library infused with modern technological aid in teaching and research is being built in the faculty to serve law students exclusively. Our e-library is constantly alive with the internet to serve the students and staff researchers. The new library aims to drive the frontier of research and knowledge-based study to ensure academic growth and professional competence.
                                    In order to create an atmosphere of the diversity of perspectives to strengthen the intellectual enquiries of our students, we have carefully designed a town and wig programme where people who are experts in the legal profession both in academia and in litigation/industry are periodically invited to give stimulating talks and professional legal discourse on diverse areas of law. Why not join us to reach these desirable academic goal and professional accomplishments.
